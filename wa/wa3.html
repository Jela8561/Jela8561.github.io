<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>
    Known during development as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox, the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003. 
    In February 2003, planning for the Xenon software platform began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President J Allard.
    That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. 
    Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft.
    On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphics processing unit for the new console, a deal that was publicly announced two days later. 
    Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. 
    This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor was running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. 
    The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. 
    According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were "hiding" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor. 
    Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360.

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

   Legacy The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. 
   The inexpensive Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. 
   The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360. 
   TechRadar proclaimed that "Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One". 
   The Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high-profile games from both first party and third-party developers. 
   The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform.
   By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft.[80] At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year. 
   As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including Devil May Cry 4, Ace Combat 6, Virtua Fighter 5, Grand Theft Auto IV, Final Fantasy XIII, Tekken 6, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, and L.A. Noire. 
   In addition, Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007, due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3.

    The Xbox 360 E revision has an additional Xbox logo to the left of the Xbox 360 branding.
    Kinect is a "controller-free gaming and entertainment experience" for the Xbox 360. 
    It was first announced on June 1, 2009, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, under the codename, Project Natal. 
    The add-on peripheral enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a game controller by using gestures, spoken commands and presented objects and images.
    The Kinect accessory is compatible with all Xbox 360 models, connecting to new models via a custom connector, and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter. 
    During their CES 2010 keynote speech, Robbie Bach and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer went on to say that Kinect would be released during the holiday period (November–January) and work with every Xbox 360 console. 
    It was released on November 4, 2010.
